Excercises from Aprende.org courses

*Note some commands are not included like the inclusion of ´float´ or 'int' before some inputs and the platform doens't explains this as they probably show older versions of VS Code or similars some be sure to check your codes for this or more details we'll be updating here.

Personal repository for exercises as Aprende.org doesn't have a ´Submit excercise´ option on it's platform.

Feel free to guide yourself on this. ;)
